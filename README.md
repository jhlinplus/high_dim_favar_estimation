In this repository, we provide both `Python` and `R` implementation of the proposed two-stage methodology. 
- For `Python` version, see `demo.ipynb`, whose source files are under `./srcPy`
- For `R` version, see `example.R`, whose source files are under `./srcR`

Note that there is some difference in the behavior of `Lasso` from sklearn in `Python` and `glmnet` from `R`, due to the discrepancy in their respective underlying implementations. The original paper, when it was being developed, replied on the `R` version.
